## Introduction

Accessibility is a core requirement in the modern world of web development. Ensuring our applications are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities, is not only ethical but is becoming a legal requirement in many areas. If you're using Angular for web development, there are various tools and techniques at your disposal to make your application more accessible. In this guide, we'll take a step-by-step look at how to write an accessible Angular application.

## WHY IS ACCESSIBILITY IMPORTANT?

Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both "direct access" (i.e., unassisted) and "indirect access," meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).

Creating accessible applications means that your applications will reach a wider audience, including the 15% of the world’s population who live with some form of disability. It also often leads to a better user experience for everyone, disability or not.

### STEP 1: UNDERSTAND ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an internationally recognized set of recommendations for improving web accessibility. They provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, and others.

Before diving into Angular's accessibility features, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with these guidelines. They're an essential reference point for developing accessible applications.

### STEP 2: USE SEMANTIC HTML

The foundation of an accessible web application is semantic HTML. It provides the necessary context to assistive technologies, enabling them to present content in a meaningful way. Angular’s directives map onto a wide variety of standard HTML elements, which can then be styled and interacted with in a standard way.

For example, use <button> elements when you need button behavior, rather than styling a <div> to look like a button. A screen reader can easily understand a <button>, while a styled <div> will not be recognized as a button without additional ARIA roles and properties.

### STEP 3: LEVERAGE ANGULAR CDK'S A11Y MODULE

Angular provides an Accessibility Module (a11y) in its Component Dev Kit (CDK). It includes tools to build accessible web applications, such as:

Live Announcer: Helps communicate changes to users who rely on screen readers by announcing specified text through an aria-live region.
Focus Monitor: Monitors the focus of elements and applies CSS classes or callbacks based on the focus origin.
Focus Trap: Traps Tab-key focus within an element. Useful for modals and other components where you don't want the user to tab out of.

### STEP 4: KEYBOARD NAVIGATION

Ensure all functionality can be achieved using only the keyboard. Many users with motor disabilities, as well as blind users, primarily use the keyboard for navigation. Angular provides tools for customizing keyboard navigation through the cdkTrapFocus and cdkFocusInitial directives.

### STEP 5: MAKE FORMS ACCESSIBLE

Forms should be accessible and intuitive. Always provide labels associated with form fields using the <label> tag or aria-label attribute. Validate forms and display helpful error messages. Angular's reactive forms provide an easy way to validate and handle form data.

### STEP 6: MANAGE FOCUS FOR ROUTES AND NAVIGATION

Managing focus when navigating routes is important to maintain a logical flow. When a user navigates to a new route, the focus should be moved to the top of the page or an appropriate element. Angular's router provides lifecycle hooks, like NavigationStart and NavigationEnd, to help manage focus on route changes.

### STEP 7: TESTING ACCESSIBILITY

You can use tools like Google's Lighthouse, axe by Deque Systems, or Wave Evaluation Tool for accessibility testing. These tools provide insights into potential accessibility issues and suggest fixes. In addition, manually test your application with a screen reader like JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver to ensure it behaves as expected.

## CONCLUSION

Accessibility is an essential aspect of web development, and Angular offers an abundance of tools and techniques to assist in creating accessible web applications. By following these steps, you will ensure your Angular application is accessible, user-friendly, and compliant with international standards, opening your application to as wide an audience as possible. Remember, creating an accessible application doesn't just benefit users with disabilities - it improves the experience for all users.
